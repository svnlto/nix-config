# Global Preferences

## Languages & Tools
- Primary: Nix, Go, HCL, Bash, Ansible, Java
- JS package manager: pnpm (never npm or yarn)
- Testing: Vitest or Jest for JS/TS projects

## Code Style
- Functional and declarative over imperative
- Immutable data, pure functions, composition
- Explicit over implicit, simple over abstract
- Clarity over cleverness

## Workflow
- Read before modifying — never assume file contents
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Question abstractions that don't solve existing problems
- Commit only when explicitly asked
